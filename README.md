# Abigail Latinwo - Data Science Portfolio

## About

Hi, I’m Abigail! I have an analytical background in Biochemistry and currently pursuing a Master’s in Data Science, I have acquired a strong foundation in life sciences and a genuine passion for utilizing data to unveil meaningful insights. I am excited to bring my analytical and technical skills to the field of data science as an entry-level data scientist.

As I continue to progress in my studies, I have enhanced my ability to work with complex data and developed a keen eye for identifying trends and patterns. I also have experience in laboratory techniques, statistical analysis, and data management, which I believe will be valuable skills in my role as a data scientist.

At leisure, I enjoy exploring new data analysis techniques and tools, and I am always seeking for opportunities to expand my skills and knowledge. Whether working as an individual or team player, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems.

My CV in PDF.

This is a repository to track my progress in Data Analysis/Science related topics, as well as show casing shared projects and skills.
